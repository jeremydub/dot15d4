# Towards a generic IEEE 802.15.4 Radio Driver Specification for Rust

The dot15d4 framework is based on a generic theory of operation and architecture
for IEEE 802.15.4 radio drivers with precision timing and generic hardware
offloading support. The goal is to make it easy for open source driver
contributors to provide and maintain truly production-grade drivers with minimal
effort and risk.

## Production-grade framework support for timed protocols and hardware offloading

Most existing IEEE 802.15.4 driver APIs don't support precise scheduling and
timing of radio tasks. Such driver APIs may be easy to implement but on real
hardware they systematically fail to conform to timing requirements defined in
the standard (e.g. inter-frame spacing, precision timestamping or scheduling of
tx and/or rx windows). This is true for all currently existing open source IEEE
802.15.4 driver APIs in the Rust language [1] and even for the Linux IEEE
802.15.4 driver API.

Also, existing driver APIs will often not generically support offloading of MAC
tasks (IFS enforcement, ACK, filtering, CRC, security, timing-critical IE and
header updates, etc.) to transceivers that implement these concerns in hardware
while still being able to fill in cross-driver, framework-provided software
implementations for hardware that doesn't have the corresponding MAC
acceleration capabilities. The few non-Rust APIs that do support precise timing
and hardware acceleration force each individual driver maintainer to
re-implement such concerns in driver- or vendor-specific code even if much of it
could be implemented generically and shared above the driver level. Even APIs in
well-known open source stacks like Contiki OS [2], RIoT OS [3] or Zephyr [4] are
no exception to this rule.

This makes addition of new drivers and maintenance of existing drivers
unnecessarily complex, costly and error prone from a maintainer perspective. In
the case of Zephyr, for example, maintaining fully compliant IEEE 802.15.4
drivers is so involved that at the time of writing, not a single fully compliant
driver had been contributed by individual community members. Only large vendors
with dedicated multi-person developer teams were able to provide
production-grade drivers for their hardware. Most of that driver-code is
vendor-specific.

The dot15d4 framework tries to fix this situation by introducing a novel
paradigm into IEEE 802.15.4 driver API design. While existing drivers invariably
abstract around some flavor of state-agnostic `send()` and `receive()` methods,
the dot15d4 driver API enforces a much lower-level state machine with distinct,
asynchronous transitions between off, rx and tx states. Driver maintainers will
only have to implement low-level transitions between radio states without having
to drive the state machine themselves.

To avoid misunderstanding: Similar low-level state machine APIs already exist
_within_ any reasonable production-grade radio driver. They also exist for other
radio protocols, e.g. in the Linux and Zephyr Bluetooth stacks. What
distinguishes the dot15d4 approach is that it defines a _shared, generic_ state
machine design to be re-used _across_ drivers independently of vendor and radio
protocol.

Based on such a low-level state machine, the framework will now be able to hide
most of the complexity: edge cases and error conditions can be handled correctly
and consistently across all drivers. At the same time it is this low-level
control over radio state that allows the framework to implement and share common
soft-MAC procedures across drivers in case a SoC doesn't implement e.g. ACK
offloading, filtering or CRC checking in hardware while maintaining full
standard compliance. Its low-level state-machine abstraction allows dot15d4 to
pre-program radio transitions ahead of time not requiring any CPU involvement on
timing-critical execution paths. Even generic intra-frame interaction with the
driver is possible, e.g. to validate and filter frame headers while the
remainder of the frame is still being received.

In contrast to this, state-agnostic send/receive-style APIs force driver
maintainers to implement the complex and error prone logic driving the radio
state machine and timing-critical soft-MAC features (like auto-ACK or frame
validation and filtering) inside the driver to achieve full standard compliance:
The send/receive abstraction requires CPU involvement _between_ radio tasks
(i.e. between `send()` and `receive()` calls) thereby standing in the way of any
hard real-time guarantees above the driver API level.

Send/receive-style driver APIs supporting at least limited precision timing
exist but systematically break encapsulation and therefore invariably burden
driver implementations with unnecessary complexity and redundancy. This is true
for proprietary drivers and open source drivers alike. To work around API
limitations, Zephyr radio drivers, for example, currently require MAC frame
parsers and writers as well as deep knowledge of CSL anchor point calculation
_inside each individual driver_ to maintain standard compliance. In Zephyr,
adding support for additional protocols like RIT, TSCH or beacon-enabled PANs
requires large changes across _all_ drivers. This is a no-go for any open source
framework expecting driver contributions from individual community members while
maintaining consistent behavior across vendors.

## Painless driver development with compile-time correctness guarantees

Transitions between radio states require vendor- and transition-specific
hardware scheduling without CPU intervention. This is necessary to enforce the
hard real-time requirements of standard-compliant inter-frame spacing and
high-precision rx/tx scheduling and timestamping. This is true for all currently
available IEEE 802.15.4 radio SoCs and transceivers on the market. Therefore all
existing production-grade drivers had to implement the kind of transitions
exposed in dot15d4's radio API anyway.

A few examples of use cases that require hardware-backed real-time operation for
full standard compliance and energy efficiency:

- Beacon-enabled PANs require precise synchronization of beacon transmissions,
  reception timestamps as well as reception and transmission during the
  contention-free period (CFP).
- CSMA/CA requires precise CCA and start-of-transmission timing.
- CSL is required to support Thread protocol versions 1.2 and later.
- TSCH is required to support IETF deterministic networking based on 6TiSCH.
- TSCH, CSL and RIT (or similar ad-hoc timed protocols) are common in
  specialized industrial use cases that may not require a full-fledged generic
  protocol like Thread or 6TiSCH but still need to optimize for battery lifetime
  or efficient usage of available bandwidth.
- Precision timing is required to support channel sounding and UWB ranging (IEEE
  802.15.4z) which again is the basis of the widely deployed FiRa protocol stack
  (e.g. in recent Android smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy, iPhone or Pixel).

Exposing low-level state transitions to a well-defined shared API therefore
doesn't increase driver development effort. Much to the contrary, it simplifies
production-grade driver design and implementation considerably: getting the
mandatory state machine right will be much easier from a driver maintainer's
viewpoint, especially for new drivers. Correctness and standard-compliance can
now be proven, enforced and maintained across all drivers at compile time. In
dot15d4 this is done via strongly typed, cross-driver typestates.

In Rust typestates, session types and simulation of linear types allows us to
lock considerable parts of _dynamic protocol behavior_ into static types along
with improved self-documentation and ergonomics of the API. In contrast,
existing implementations of task-based drivers as expressed in the C language
are often hard to follow and prove correct.

## Capabilities beyond IEEE 802.15.4

The dot15d4 driver design not only guarantees IEEE 802.15.4 standard compliance
of drivers but also unlocks additional capabilities for research into novel
high-precision timing and radio scheduling approaches beyond the standard. Plus
it is generic enough to also implement other radio protocols. It would for
example be entirely possible to implement a generic bt-hci compatible Bluetooth
controller above dot15d4's low level driver API, thereby dramatically reducing
controller implementation effort for new or existing hardware in Rust.

# The dot15d4 Radio Driver Model

The classic send/receive radio driver model is attractive from a framework
developer viewpoint. It conceives radio drivers as event-driven, reactive
components that execute mutually isolated driver operations (herein called
driver "tasks") one by one "as fast as possible" after they have been scheduled
by the framework. Frameworks based on a send/receive driver model only ever need
to be aware of the currently executed task or payload and do not have to care
about previous or subsequent tasks or payloads. Timing restrictions across
distinct radio tasks are abstracted away and ignored, in most cases simply
assuming that CPUs will be "fast enough" to stay within limits. Based on such a
model, frameworks may abstract low-level driver operation away in favor of high
level "full-duplex packet streams".

This model of execution dramatically simplifies framework design and
implementation. This probably explains its popularity in both Rust and C despite
its obvious downsides.

While a "full duplex" pair of sequential packet channels continues to be a good
abstraction for high-level socket-like communication (OSI 3+) it turns out that
additional design sophistication is required to support state-of-the-art IEEE
802.15.4 radio hardware when designing a production-grade IEEE 802.15.4 MAC <->
PHY/Driver interface:

- CPUs interacting with all common radio hardware (radio peripherals or external
  services) are currently neither fast nor deterministic enough to handle the
  precise timing requirements of the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol or the even more
  rigid requirements of state-of-the-art low-energy radio protocol execution.
- Therefore all common radio hardware implements low-level optimizations outside
  the control of the CPU to ensure deterministic "hard realtime" execution. This
  includes offloading of MAC-level tasks to hardware or hardware-optimized event
  infrastructures (peripheral interconnect, interrupts, event-triggered hardware
  tasks, etc.)
- Such hardware optimizations have to be pre-arranged in advance by the CPU
  usually concurrently with ongoing radio operations.

To make it worse, current hardware not only automates execution of isolated
pre-programmed radio tasks but also requires specific optimization of
transitions between _pairs_ of tasks (e.g. fast rx-to-tx and the reverse,
hardware-assisted chaining of CCA and tx operations, chaining of rx and ACK
sending as well as tx and ACK reception, etc.). This means that driver
implementations need to be able to provide different execution paths for each
combination of subsequent tasks. This is fundamentally impossible in the
send/receive model which is only ever aware of the currently executed task and
therefore cannot pipeline future operations while the current task is still
executing.

A fundamental shift in driver design is required to support task pipelining:

- **tasks** rather than packets: The link layer scheduler needs to be aware of
  low-level driver primitives in addition to "packets" or "frames". The driver,
  on the other hand, knows nothing about upper-layer abstractions unless
  offloaded to hardware.
- **timed** rather than "best effort": The scheduler provides precise timing
  instructions to the driver in advance rather than letting the driver
  autonomously schedule operations at some underspecified point-in-time in the
  future. Several standard protocols require precise scheduling decisions to be
  taken at short notice, up to a few µs before task switching actually occurs.
- **active** scheduling (forward control) rather than reactive event execution
  (inversion of control): The scheduler actively pre-programs the driver in
  parallel with ongoing task execution rather than the driver reactively and
  sequentially executing queued operations. This requires the scheduler to peek
  the next task while the previous task's result is not yet available. Purely
  sequential queuing (think: "embassy-net-driver-channel") is impossible - even
  towards the network stack above the link layer.
- **isochronous** rather than asynchronous: Due to limited buffering of hardware
  peripherals, to support low latency scheduling decisions and to simplify
  driver implementation, buffering or queueing of tasks between scheduler and
  driver beyond the next task (1-pipeline) is impossible. Schedulers may only
  program the next task while the current task is already running. This requires
  the scheduler to closely synchronize its activities with driver progress.

## Framework policy and migration path

Once a framework depends on a send/receive driver model, it is very hard to
change due to the fundamentally different architecture required for a
scheduled/pipelined model. The driver model defines the API between driver and
framework maintainers. Any change to the driver model will therefore have to go
through a lengthy deprecation procedure that will hardly succeed in introducing
a fundamentally new design as legacy obligations continue to weigh upon it.

Frameworks starting out with a send/receive model, hoping to add on timing and
scheduling features later, will face severe migration issues. The examples of
both, Linux and the Zephyr OS, show that such migration will hardly happen as
the hurdle to switch from a send/receive to a pipelined model is too high for
most community driver maintainers. At the time of writing, only two large
vendors introduced specific aspects of scheduled rx/tx in Zephyr, while all
other drivers remain locked into the send/receive approach - not even able to
support Zephyr's IEEE 802.15.4 flagship protocol Thread 1.2+. This is because
the scheduled model was built around single-vendor single-protocol abstractions
that don't fit other hardware or sub-protocols well. To my best knowledge there
is no scheduling-capable IEEE 802.15.4 driver available in Linux at all.

Understandably, no single vendor or driver maintainer has a fundamental interest
in investing into a vendor- or protocol-agnostic glue layer - although - as the
examples of Linux, Zephyr and many others show - driver maintainers are usually
very open to adapt to a framework's abstractions as they reduce everyone's
individual effort even if those abstractions are more sophisticated than what
any single maintainer would have introduced on their own.

It is therefore the framework maintainers that have a fundamental interest in
providing re-usable glue code early on as this increases the chance of
additional contributions by a broader community of independent driver
maintainers or vendors.

Contrary to Linux and Zephyr, there are not a lot of Rust legacy drivers that
need to be supported or migrated. To my best knowledge only a simple nRF52840
driver exists for embassy/smoltcp and an even simpler one inside the nrf hal
crate. A Decawave/qorvo driver exists for lr-wpan-rs. These drivers can
realistically be migrated towards a fully scheduled driver implementation and
then serve as examples for future driver maintainers: Traits locking in
fundamental data types and scheduled protocol behavior guide new driver
development towards the "right" solution. Such traits abstract tasks and
transitions between tasks as explained above.

## Driver API Requirements

We collected the following, non-exhaustive list of requirements to guide
framework and driver implementation.

Requirements defining the scope of the proposal:

- **R01.01** The driver model SHALL provide abstractions viable for all SoCs
  with IEEE 802.15.4 radio hardware already supported by embassy and
  smoltcp/dot15d4.
- **R01.02** Driver model abstractions SHOULD be viable for as many other IEEE
  802.15.4 SoCs available on the market as possible - independently of IEEE
  802.15.4 radio PHY (O-QPSK, BPSK, GFSK, SUN, UWB, ...) and band (2.4G, SubG,
  wideband/chirp, ...).

The driver model SHALL present a minimal barrier to entry while remaining open
to highly sophisticated hardware-optimized implementations:

- **R02.01** The driver model SHALL focus on a minimal set of low-level PHY
  features and thereby remain unencumbered by MAC features as far as possible.
  MAC features MAY become part of the driver model if (and only if) at least one
  of the supported SoCs provides hardware offloading for the feature. Typical
  examples of hardware-backed features currently available on widely used SoCs:
  - features to improve energy efficiency (fast and precise handling of radio
    ramp-up/tear-down)
  - features to improve standard compliance (fast rx-to-tx switching, fast ACK,
    inter-frame-space enforcement, etc.)
  - high precision timing of packet sending and receive windows
  - high precision timestamping of incoming and outgoing packets (including
    sub-ns-precision ranging timestamps on UWB hardware),
  - automatic CCA, CSMA/CA, CRC checking, ACK, etc.
  - automatic resending of packets,
  - hardware-optimized packet encryption, decryption and signing,
  - hardware-optimized packet filtering (PAN, addressing, etc.),
  - MAC/PHY header and information element mangling - e.g. to inject
    timing-sensitive data on-the-fly (e.g. timestamps to synchronize TSCH
    networks or specify CSL anchor points)
- **R02.02** Drivers SHALL support at the following tasks: Radio Off (low-power
  state), Rx, Tx including all relevant transitions. This low-level design SHALL
  be enforced statically.
- **R02.05** The model SHALL provide default software implementations and
  polyfills for all generic and non-mandatory driver features to ease initial
  driver development.
- **R02.03** The model SHALL provide hooks or configuration to selectively and
  optionally replace arbitrary generic software features by driver- or
  vendor-specific implementations that take advantage of proprietary hardware
  optimizations to improve performance and standard compliance .
- **R02.04** Drivers SHALL be fully functional without providing optimized
  transitions between pairs of tasks. Drivers MAY individually optimize a
  transition between any pair of tasks taking full advantage of hardware
  optimizations (e.g. execution shortcuts, peripheral interconnect, event
  subsystems, CPU-less integration with other peripherals like clocks or timers,
  etc.).
- **R02.05** Drivers SHOULD ensure execution within the temporal limits and
  guard times defined in IEEE 802.15.4 (AIFS, SIFS, LIFS, Turnaround Times, CCA
  times, etc.) but MAY deviate for practical reasons (e.g. to simplify initial
  implementation or due to lack of hardware support).

The driver model SHOULD be easy to integrate with embassy applications but
should remain independent from the embassy execution model so that it can be
used independently of the framework as part of an independent IEEE
802.15.4-backed network stack (e.g. in the dot15d4 or lr-wpan-rs crates). The
initial model focuses on asynchronous execution but synchronous blocking or
non-blocking implementations SHOULD be easy to derive:

- **R03.01** Abstractions SHALL follow the model of asynchronous execution and
  SHALL be easy to integrate into the embassy framework.
- **R03.02** Abstractions MAY refer to embassy-specific asynchronous plumbing
  but SHALL limit dependencies to code (crates) that can be used independently
  of the embassy executor (e.g. with RTIC or other asynchronous execution
  engines), network stack (e.g. smoltcp, dot15d4, lr-wpan-rs, etc.) and embassy
  hal (embassy-nrf).
- **R03.03** Implementations SHOULD depend on PACs directly rather than on any
  HAL as the community has not yet converged on common HALs for all hardware.
  Implementations MAY depend on HALs if those provide important added value to
  an implementation that would otherwise have to be replicated inside dot15d4.

A few general performance, correctness and safety requirements apply as to any
low-level embedded Rust code:

- **R04.01** Abstractions SHOULD be zero-cost wherever possible.
- **R04.02** Abstractions SHOULD statically enforce correct state and behavior
  wherever possible (e.g. via strong types on state, session types/typestates,
  linear types, separation of role and state, etc.).
- **R04.03** Abstractions SHOULD be panic-free whenever possible.

Implementations SHALL support best effort execution (no support for precisely
scheduled tasks or timestamps). Implementations SHOULD support timed execution
(tasks scheduled to precisely timed timeslots, precisely measured timestamps).
MAC protocols that require precise timing (TSCH, CSL, RIT, BE PANs, etc.) will
only be supported by drivers implementing timed execution.

Minimal requirements for the "best effort" fragment of the overall model:

- **R05.01** The framework SHALL be able to schedule the next driver task while
  the previous task is still being executed. The framework SHALL NOT schedule
  more than one task in advance.
- **R05.02** Tasks SHALL be executed by the driver precisely in the order they
  were scheduled. Re-ordering or prioritizing one task over the other (e.g. tx
  over rx) is NOT part of the driver's responsibilities and SHALL be implemented
  in the framework.
- **R05.03** Reception of packets targeted to the device SHALL not be cancelled
  mid-frame. Depending on hardware filtering capabilities "targeted" can mean
  "any packet with the correct SHR", "packets with the correct PAN and
  addressing" or even "packets with the correct signature and encryption". An
  already started packet (SHR recognized) takes precedence over sending of
  packets. (Note: CSMA/CA and other forms of CCA implicitly enforce this rule.
  In some countries there are even legal requirements to "listen-before-send",
  e.g. in SubG bands. So drivers cannot make progress towards tx by cancelling
  active rx anyway.)

Requirements specific to the timed/scheduled fragment of the overall model:

- **R06.01** Each task MAY be assigned a precise start time by upper layers,
  defined by a single edge of the radio clock (see [timer driver framework
  specification](../timer/README.md)). This implicitly allocates an execution
  window to each task between its own start tick and the start tick of the
  subsequent task. Tasks that do not have a start time SHALL be executed "as
  fast as possible" as soon as the previous tasks has finished ("best effort
  execution")
- **R06.02** Upper layers SHALL ensure that tasks are scheduled in advance
  respecting protocol- and driver-specific guard times. Upper layers SHALL
  allocate sufficiently large task execution windows for each task. Drivers
  SHALL reject tasks that do not respect guard times and execution times.
- **R06.03** If the upper layer does not schedule a subsequent task after the
  immediate task has been executed then the following rules apply:
  - Radio Off task: The radio is kept in low-power mode.
  - RX task: The radio is kept powered and idle in rx mode (as supported by the
    hardware) but will ignore any incoming packet.
  - TX task: The radio is kept powered and idle in tx mode (as supported by the
    hardware) and will ignore any incoming packet.
- **R06.04** Scheduling SHALL be aware of the minimal operation-specific "guard
  time" required by the driver to update its state, i.e. only such tasks SHALL
  be accepted that can still be scheduled on-time on the underlying hardware.
- **R06.05** During "Radio Off" windows, the driver MAY disable the radio and
  put the peripheral into the lowest possible energy consumption mode. Protocols
  optimized for battery-supplied devices (Thread, 6TiSCH, etc.) upgrade this
  requirement to "SHALL".
- **R06.06** Ongoing reception of a frame MAY be continued even if the reception
  window already ended and the following "radio off" or "send" window started.
  The model SHALL make this feature configurable so that upper layers MAY
  control driver behavior in this respect.

Requirements to support non-standard, protocol-specific or vendor-specific
extensions:

- **R07.06** Drivers MAY support vendor-specific or non-standard tasks or
  configuration extensions including corresponding vendor-specific/non-standard
  scheduler or other upper-layer extensions. Vendor-specific or
  protocol-specific tasks or extensions SHALL NOT be introduced into the
  vendor-agnostic API but SHALL be kept in separate files and SHOULD be placed
  behind feature flags to prove proper encapsulation (API and implementation).
- **R07.07** Upper layers SHALL prove sufficient capacity for handling packets
  and other operations by presenting the driver with pre-allocated buffers, task
  structures and any other required resources.

## Radio Driver Tasks

The notion of _radio driver tasks_ is essential to the proposed architecture.
Driver tasks compromise between re-usability of drivers by a generic scheduler
component while at the same time providing low-level primitives to cater for
state-of-the-art radio hardware features.

The IEEE 802.15.4 standard leaves the details of the MAC <-> PHY/Driver
interface up to implementors. We therefore remain fully standard compliant, if
we identify driver tasks by the following criteria:

1. Tasks need to be large enough (time extension) to be programmable by a CPU -
   ideally with maximal CPU sleep time in between for best energy efficiency.
2. For best re-use and compatibility of drivers, tasks need to specify generic
   pieces of work that can be applied to all recent hardware, no matter its
   vendor-specific capabilities.
3. The task repertoire needed for a minimal working driver should be as small as
   possible to keep the entry hurdle for community driver maintainers low.

Typical examples of generic (implementation-independent) task primitives are:

- "Send a packet over the air such that it's RMARKER will pass the antenna at
  the precise radio clock tick T. Encrypt and sign the packet on-the-fly."
- "Ensure that the receiver is on just-in-time so that it'll be able to
  recognize a packet whose RMARKER is expected to pass the antenna at the
  precise radio clock tick T +/- X ticks potential clock drift. Keep the
  receiver on for precisely Y ticks or until an incoming packet is fully
  received - whatever comes later - and then got to low-energy idle."
- "Use an Enh-Ack to acknowledge the next incoming packet precisely after AIFS -
  measured as X radio clock ticks. Ensure that it contains a timing header whose
  timestamp you'll mangle based on the rx timestamp of the preceding packet."
- "Do a CCA of precisely aCcaTime, then - if the channel is idle - immediately
  send a packet after aTurnaroundTime. If the channel is busy then place the
  radio in low-energy mode as quickly as possible. Calculate everything such
  that the RMARKER of the tx packet will pass the antenna at the precise radio
  clock tick T."
- "Either observe the start of a packet within a given precise reception window
  or otherwise deterministically disable the radio at the end of the reception
  window and got to low-energy idle."

Some SoCs will be able to execute full tasks of the above kind without any CPU
intervention. Others will require such tasks to be partially controlled by CPU,
again others need them to be implemented in software alone - sometimes with
reduced standard compliance (which is good enough for many applications and
needs to be supported in practice).

### Minimal set of tasks

Even the simplest driver will have to implement a minimal set of driver tasks to
support basic protocol operations.

Based on the above criteria the following initial tasks need to be implemented
by all drivers - even in the simplest "best effort" scenario:

- "Radio Off" task: asks the driver to place the radio receiver in a low-power
  mode for improved energy efficiency
- rx task: asks the driver to enable the radio receiver, contains a buffer to
  receive a single frame
- tx task: asks the driver to enable the radio transmitter, contains a buffer
  with the frame to be sent

"Radio Off" is modeled as a task in its own right rather than being defined as
the "absence" of other tasks:

- The radio driver state machine is modeled entirely around tasks, i.e. tasks
  are just state machine states. Defining a radio off _state_ then automatically
  requires existence of a corresponding _task_.
- It turns out that low-energy protocols require sleep periods to be defined as
  precisely scheduled time windows just as rx or tx windows.
- The scheduling API is simplified if all radio states can be scheduled in the
  same way.

The rx task is executed in two sub-states:

- A listening state that is active while the receiver is able to observe the
  start of a frame but before a frame has been observed (or the rx window
  ended).
- A receiving state that is entered as soon as the start of a frame has
  been observed during the reception window and until reception of that frame
  finishes (or reception times out).

CCA is part of the tx task:

CSMA/CA requires control of isolated CCA operations with potentially long
subsequent backoff periods. Performance testing showed that CCA is too short on
2.4G O-QSPK for the CPU to keep up. So CCA needs to be part of the tx task. When
CCA succeeds, the driver will enter the tx state, otherwise it will fall back to
"Radio Off" state. Such non-deterministic task outcomes allow CSMA/CA, TSCH CCA,
etc. to be part of the framework. With non-deterministic tx tasks, backoff
periods can be modeled generically across drivers as "Radio Off" fallback tasks
if executing a tx tasks fails due to CCA busy.

### ACK hardware offloading

Some vendors have built in support for either automated acknowledgement or
sophisticated mangling of ACK frames (e.g. to insert sequence numbers or
timing-critical information at runtime). Therefore drivers MAY implement ACK
offloading (auto-ACK):

- Send ACK flag of the rx task: asks the driver to send an immediate or enhanced
  acknowledgement frame (Imm-Ack or Enh-Ack) in response to receiving a frame as
  part of an rx task.
- Wait for ACK flag of the tx task: asks the driver to wait (with timeout) for
  an Imm-Ack or Enh-Ack after a tx tasks finishes.

### Behavioral modeling of task transitions

The model treats transitions between tasks as driver primitives, i.e.
hardware-accelerated _pairs_ of tasks like off-to-rx, off-to-tx, rx-to-tx,
tx-to-rx, rx-to-rx, tx-to-tx, tx-to-off and rx-to-off switching occupy separate
API methods. In Rust, making use of the typestate pattern, it is easy and
efficient to implement different code paths depending on runtime state while
also statically proving overall behavioral correctness. We therefore use the
typestate pattern to enforce correct implementation of individual task
transition pairs.

The typestate pattern may seem more verbose or complex than send/receive drivers
at first sight, but it turns out to be the simpler driver model in practice as
it replaces the combinatorial explosion of runtime logic branches by a single
API method per statically implemented transition pair.

Note that code implementing state-aware per-transition optimizations at runtime
(like the few timing-capable drivers in Zephyr) require drivers to implement the
same state machine without the ability to validate it at compile time. Having
the state machine pre-defined in the API makes it easier to implement and
validate and removes boilerplate and shared logic from driver implementations.

The driver task scheduler becomes more expressive and typesafe when done in
terms of static state representations. Trying to take execution paths that are
not supported by the state machine, will result in compile-time errors.

The typestate representation of a state machine can be converted into a runtime
representation and back using Rust variants (enums). So whenever there is
potential for simplification by expressing runtime conditions on states (e.g. in
the scheduler), we take advantage of a corresponding runtime representations of
the state machine without compromising the typestate pattern's expressiveness
and guarantees.

Communicating state machines expressed as typestates open up opportunities for
further linear programming and advanced protocol modeling with session types.
These techniques were applied on top of typestates where appropriate.

Summarizing: The foundational model of the driver and scheduler is abstract
communicating state machines. Scheduler/driver communication protocols have been
further refined in terms of typestates, session types and linear programming
where appropriate. These are modeling techniques that open up the possibility to
further formally verify parts of the implementation later on with separation
logic, process algebra or temporal logic verification tools.

# Task timing

## "Best effort" timing

The "best effort" model allows drivers to execute tasks "as fast as possible" as
they arrive. Each driver will have to specify a driver-specific guard-time, i.e.
a guaranteed scheduling-to-execution time.

All tasks exist in a "best effort" version without execution timestamp. Based on
the driver-specific guard time, schedulers will schedule such tasks just-in-time
for the driver to pick them up and execute them reactively.

Note: Even when "timed" tasks are available, applications for tasks without
pre-calculated timing are useful. Tasks often need to be executed "immediately
after" some previous task of unknown length. If "best effort" is replaced with
the standard-defined inter-frame timing, we get precise timing even if the exact
point in time of some task cannot be deterministically calculated in advance.

Examples:

- acknowledgement
- sending or receiving several frames "as fast as possible"
- responses to commands
- ...

## "Scheduled" timing

Drivers meant to support timed protocols (TSCH, CSL, beacon-enabled PANs, etc.)
SHALL implement precise timing of radio tasks to achieve state-of-the art
protocol compliance and energy efficiency.

### The role of RMARKERs in scheduled timing

Central to timed rx/tx is the notion of the "RMARKER" or equivalently "start of
physical header (PHR)", "end of synchronization header (SHR)" or "the beginning
of the symbol following the start-of-frame (SFD) delimiter".

At the time of writing, the most precise definition of the RMARKER is given in
IEEE 802.15.4-2020z, section 6.9.1.1. This definition subsumes and replaces all
other definitions given in different protocol contexts or prior versions of the
standard:

"For all PHYs the RMARKER is defined to be the time when the beginning of the
first symbol following the SFD of the frame is at the local antenna."

This is the exact point in time that any rx/tx timestamp designates relative to
the local radio clock. Any offsets to this definition (e.g. due to hardware
guard times or signal times between the SoC and the antenna) need to be taken
into account and corrected for internally by driver implementations.

Any window widening or timestamp adjustment required to cater for local or
remote clock drift or global clock synchronization SHALL be calculated by the
client. It is the driver's sole responsibility to schedule radio operations as
precisely as possible according to its local radio clock.

Clients MAY adjust timing calculations based on transmission and reception
timestamps provided by the radio driver (e.g. comparing expected and actual
reception times to derive clock drift relative to a peer device's radio clock).

The driver SHALL communicate a guard time to the client. This is the max. time
required by the driver after scheduling a timed reception or transmission to
ramp up the radio, start reception or transmission until emitting the RMARKER.
I.e. the guard time determines the latest possible time at which a client may
schedule a window relative to the window's RMARKER timestamp.

### Specification of task timing

Definition of task timing:

- rx task: a precisely defined time window during which the radio receiver SHALL
  be able to observe and receive incoming packets. The task is split into a
  listening phase (rx window) and an (optional) reception phase.
- tx task: a period with a precise start time during which a given packet SHALL
  be sent if (and only if) potential tx predicates are true (e.g. successful
  prior CCA).
- "Radio Off" task: a precisely defined time window during which the radio
  peripheral SHALL be placed into a minimal energy consumption state (no rx/tx).

Timed tasks may contain the following data:

- a sufficiently precise (in protocol / energy efficiency terms) timestamp that
  determines an RMARKER relative to the local monotonic and overflow-protected
  radio clock, given in (parts of) nanoseconds, radio clock ticks or symbols
  (see the [timer driver specification](../timer/README.md)).
  - The significance of the timestamp depends on the task type.
  - In case of rx tasks, the timestamp points to the expected earliest RMARKER at
    which a packet is to be expected at the local antenna.
  - In case of tx tasks, the timestamp points to the time at which the RMARKER
    of the packet SHALL pass the local antenna, drivers SHALL account for CCA
    time if CCA is requested.
  - In case of "Radio Off" tasks ending a reception window, the timestamp points
    to the earliest time at which detection of new packets is no longer required
    (i.e. any packet with an earlier RMARKER SHALL still be detected in a
    preceding rx window).
- for rx tasks:
  - an associated zero-copy mutable packet buffer
  - any hints regarding hardware offloading features (decryption/signing
    context, CRC parameters, packet filtering, etc.)
- for tx tasks:
  - an associated zero-copy mutable packet buffer - mutability is required for
    certain last-minute patches offloaded to hardware
  - hints regarding the CCA mode to be employed (see section 10.2.8)
  - any hints regarding hardware offloading features (CRC parameters, encryption
    or signing, header mangling, etc.),
- for "Radio Off" tasks:
  - hints regarding the low-energy-state to be reached

Note that clock drift is an important factor, but it is assumed that the
scheduler takes the responsibility to calculate guard times for clock drift and
sets timestamps accordingly. Drivers SHALL NOT have to deal with drift
calculations.

Also note that end-timestamps are not given:

- All tasks end by the subsequent task's start timestamp less appropriate
  hardware-specific guard times. If no subsequent task has been scheduled then
  tasks are defined to take "forever", i.e. the radio remains in the state that
  it was left by task execution ("off" for "Radio Off", tx/rx idle for tx/rx
  tasks). This allows the scheduler to deal with situations when the details of
  the next task are not yet known but it is known that the next task will be of
  a certain kind (e.g. it may be required to keep the receiver on for fast
  scheduling of another rx task without long ramp-up times).
- It is the scheduler's responsibility to ensure that standard-defined guard
  times (AIFS, SIFS, LIFS, aTurnoverTime, aCcaTime, etc.) will be respected when
  defining timestamps of subsequent tasks. The driver may check such conditions
  and reject offending tasks with a non-recoverable error.
- Schedulers also need to ensure that the minimal and maximal execution time of
  the previous task is always allowed for when scheduling new tasks. Therefore
  drivers can reject tasks with a non-recoverable error if they cannot be
  scheduled in time without having to abort the previous task.

These rules allow for flexible ad-hoc scheduling of tasks while keeping driver
implementations as simple as possible.

Note that correct timing may have regulatory relevance: CCA, for example, must
be executed for some minimal time for protocol compliance (see aCcaTime, section
11.3, table 11-1) plus any additional energy detection due to regulatory
compliance (see section 10.2.8).

Initially, while no task is scheduled at all, an immediate "RadioOff" task is
assumed to be active indefinitely.

### Timing of "best effort" tasks

As mentioned, the timing of "best effort" task execution is precisely defined.
"Best effort" tasks will be executed "immediately" after the preceding task.
"Immediately" means "as fast as possible modulo guard times imposed by hardware
delays or standard inter-frame-spacing rules":

- Rx and "Radio Off" tasks SHALL be ended immediately after receiving a
  subsequent "best-effort" tx, rx or "Radio Off" task unless the receiver is
  currently receiving a valid frame targeted to the current device. In the
  latter case the next tasks will be executed immediately after finishing packet
  reception with the appropriate inter-frame space.
- Tx tasks will be fully executed before switching to execute any subsequently
  scheduled "best effort" rx or "radio off" task after an appropriate
  inter-frame space. Drivers MAY implement fast hardware-supported tx-to-rx/off
  switching in this case.
- Driver's SHALL enforce precise IFS timing before starting any "best effort"
  task.

# The state machine model

The state machine diagram documents the driver's state machine model.

The model defines the minimal interface, drivers will initially have to
implement. Drivers implement isolated "Radio Off", rx and tx states.
Acknowledgments are implemented in software by the scheduler.

The driver asynchronously signals task results when the scheduled packet has
been received or was sent.

# Example 1: Driver Timing

The following example shows a typical scheduling procedure.

Timing is based on the 2.4G O-QPSK PHY which demands a 250kbs data rate (section
12.2.2). A single data octet is encoded by two symbols (section 12.2.4).

A hardware model similar to that of the nRF SoC series is assumed. Nevertheless,
the example should be transferable to other hardware. The example uses precise
hardware-specific guard times of the nRF52840 to make it more practically
relevant.

## PHY-specific timing parameters

The symbol rate in 2.4G O-QSPK is (250k / 8) \* 2 = 62.5k symbols per second. Or
alternatively a **symbol period of 16µs**.

The PHY's protocol data unit (PPDU) consists of a synchronization header (SHR),
the PHY header (PHR) and the PHY payload which contains the MAC frame (MAC
protocol data unit, MPDU).

In case of the O-QPSK PHY, the **SHR** consists of a preamble (4 octets, 8
symbols, 128µs) and the **start-of-frame delimiter** (SFD, 1 octet = 2 symbols,
32µs), see section 12.1.2.

The **PHR** consists of a single octet (2 symbols, 32µs).

Depending on the frame type and length, required inter-frame spacing (IFS)
between transmitted frames is as follows (sections 6.2.4 and 6.7.4.3):

- Turnaround time: **12 symbol periods** for O-QPSK (aTurnaroundTime, min. time
  required to switch from rx to tx or inverse, see section 11.3, table 11-1)
- short IFS (SIFS) after MPDUs <= 18 octets: **12 symbol periods** for O-QPSK (
  see sections 10.1.4 and aMaxSifsFrameSize 8.4.2, table 8-93)
- long IFS (LIFS) after MPDUs > 18 octets: **40 symbol periods** for O-QPSK
  (ibid.)
- ACK IFS (AIFS): **12 symbol periods** for O-QPSK (same as SIFS, see section
  6.7.4.3)

Similar definitions apply to other PHYs. Therefore the following timing examples
need to be adapted for other PHYs but will structurally remain the same.

## Hardware-specific timing parameters

Driver implementations have to cater for hardware-specific ramp-up and tear-down
times.

In the case of the nRF52840 these are (nRF52840 PS, sections 6.20.15.8 and
6.20.15.10):

- RXEN/TXEN->READY: 40µs +/- 0.25µs (fast ramp-up)
- TX: DISABLE->OFF: max. 21µs
- RX: DISABLE->OFF: max. 0.5µs
- RX-to-TX/TX-to-RX turnaround: ~40µs

## Task timing example.

Example: Radio is initially off

Next Upper Layer:

- queues a tx packet into to the scheduler's tx queue.

Scheduler:

- calculates a PSDU/MPDU of 18 bytes (tx packet 16 bytes + 2 bytes FCS),
- allocates a tx task and calculates the packet's desired RMARKER in terms of
  the local radio clock as "tx timestamp 1",
- transmits the timestamped tx task to the driver with sufficient guard time as
  required by the driver's configuration.

Driver:

- sets the radio peripheral's tx DMA pointer to the start of the PPDU in the tx
  task,
- calculates the hardware specific time to ramp up the radio,
- calculates the PHY specific time required to send the synchronization header
  (SHR),
- configures and arms a timer to fire at time "tx timestamp/RMARKER - SHR send
  time - tx ramp up time",
- configures the timer interrupt to trigger the "on-complete" action of the
  "Radio Off" state machine state,
- configures the timer event to trigger the vendor-specific tx ramp-up task,
- configures the vendor-specific "tx ready" event to trigger the vendor-specific
  "tx start" task,
- configures the "START" interrupt to trigger the "on-entry" action of the "Tx"
  state machine state,
- configures the "END" event to trigger the "on-complete" action of the "Tx"
  state machine state.

The "on-entry" action of the tx task signals to the scheduler that the driver is
ready to accept scheduling of the next task.

Scheduler:

- allocates a "best effort" rx task to wait for the acknowledgment,
- schedules the rx task to the driver with sufficient guard time as required by
  the driver's configuration while the tx task is still being executed.

Driver:

- calculates the minimum time to ramp-down the radio and ramp it back up in rx
  mode
- depending on the result: decides to temporarily disable the receiver
- sets the radio peripheral's rx DMA pointer to a buffer that will receive the
  acknowledgement frame,
- configures and arms a timer to fire at time "ACK timestamp/RMARKER - SHR
  receive time - rx ramp up time",
- configures the timer event to trigger the vendor-specific rx ramp-up task,
- configures the vendor-specific "rx ready" event to trigger the vendor-specific
  "rx start" task,
- configures the "START" interrupt to trigger the "on-entry" action of the "Wait
  for ACK" state machine state,
- configures the "END" event to trigger the "on-complete" action of the "Wait
  for ACK" state machine state.
- configures and arms a timeout timer signalling a "no ACK" situation,
- etc.

PHY specific timing parameters (see above):

- PPDU: SHR 5 octets + PHR 1 octet + MPDU 18 octets = **50 symbol periods**
- AIFS = SIFS = aTurnaroundTime: **12 symbol periods** (MPDU <= 18 octets)
- LIFS: **40 symbol periods** (MPDU > 18 octets)
- Imm-Ack: SHR 5 octets + PHR 1 octet + MPDU 5 octets = 11 octets = **22 symbol
  periods**
- clock drift compensation: 2\*{drift in ppm}\*{time since last clock sync} =
  assuming max. **1 symbol period** in my example

# Example 2: Scheduling CSMA/CA

Second example: unslotted CSMA/CA random access w/o PCA (section 6.2.5.1) with
the following default parameters applicable to the 2.4G O-QPSK PHY.

- macMinBE: **3** (section 8.4.3.1, table 8-94)
- macMaxBE: **5** (ibid.)
- macMaxCsmaBackoffs: **4** (ibid.)
- aTurnaroundTime: **12 symbol periods** (section 11.3, table 11-1)
- aCcaTime: **8 symbol periods** (ibid.)
- aUnitBackoffPeriod: aTurnaroundTime + aCcaTime

The maximum CSMA/CA backup time that can still lead to a successful transmission
is:

- max. number of CSMA/CA rounds multiplied with the max. time per CSMA/CA round

The max. number of CSMA/CA rounds:

- macMaxCsmaBackoffs + 1 = 5

The max. time per CSMA/CA round for the 2.4G O-QPSK PHY:

- max. random delay: (2^BE-1) \* aUnitBackoffPeriod = (2^BE-1) \* 320µs where BE
  is macMinBE initially and min(BE+1, macMaxBE) subsequently, see section
  6.2.5.1
- aCcaTime: 128µs
- driver-specific CPU time for CSMA/CA loop control: in the order of a few
  cycles per CSMA/CA round if well implemented, let's say 2µs in my example

This yields the max. time for each round as follows:

- Round 0: BE=3, 2^BE-1=7, max. delay=7\*320µs=2240µs, incl. CCA/CPU: **2370µs**
- Round 1: BE=4, 2^BE-1=15, max. delay=15\*320µs=4800µs, incl. CCA/CPU:
  **4930µs**
- Rounds 2-5: BE=5, 2^BE-1=31, max. delay=31\*320µs=9920µs, incl. CCA/CPU:
  **10050µs**

These timings show, that CSMA/CA cannot be treated efficiently inside timed tx
tasks alone. This explains the proposed CCA task which can be interleaved with
tx, rx and RadioOff tasks to concurrently listen for incoming packets or support
low-energy operation during CSMA/CA backoff periods.
