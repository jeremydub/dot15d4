//! A bounded channel for sending requests from multiple asynchronous tasks to
//! one or many receiving task(s) with backpressure.
//!
//! The channel is not synchronized across threads. It can be used concurrently
//! by multiple producer (sender) and consumer (receiver) tasks as long as all
//! are managed by a single executor (thread).
//!
//! The channel has a limit on the number of messages that it can store. If this
//! limit is reached, trying to send another message will exert backpressure on
//! the sender.
//!
//! The channel exposes a sender and a receiver API.
//!
//! 1. Sender API:
//!
//!   - [`Sender::allocate_request_token()`]
//!     Waits until a request token becomes available and returns it.
//!
//!   - [`Sender::poll_allocate_request_token()`]
//!     Poll function that can be used to build futures waiting for request
//!     token availability.
//!
//!   - [`Sender::try_allocate_request_token()`]
//!     Try to allocate a request token without blocking.
//!
//!   - [`Sender::release_request_token()`]
//!     Releases an allocated request token without sending a request.
//!
//!   - [`Sender::send_request_no_response()`]
//!     Consumes a request token to send the given request. Returns
//!     synchronously without waiting for delivery. Any response produced by the
//!     receiver will be dropped.
//!
//!   - [`Sender::send_request_polling_response()`]
//!     Sends the given request without consuming the request token. Returns
//!     synchronously without waiting for delivery. The response produced by the
//!     receiver must actively awaited or polled, see
//!     [`Sender::wait_for_response()`] and [`Sender::try_receive_response()`].
//!
//!   - [`Sender::wait_for_response()`]
//!     Asynchronously waits until a response matching any of the given request
//!     tokens becomes available. Removes the matching request token from the
//!     vector, consumes it and produces the corresponding response together
//!     with its message slot id (see [`RequestToken::message_slot()`]). The
//!     latter can be used to correlate the response to a pending request.
//!
//!   - [`Sender::try_receive_response()`]
//!     Synchronously checks whether a response matching any of the given
//!     request tokens is pending. If so, returns the pending response together
//!     with the corresponding message slot id.
//!
//!   - [`Sender::send_request_awaiting_response()`]
//!     Consumes a request token to send the given request and waits until it
//!     was delivered to the receiver. Returns the response produced by the
//!     receiver.
//!
//!   - [`Sender::send_request()`]
//!     A convenience method over [`Sender::allocate_request_token()`] and
//!     [`Sender::send_request_awaiting_response()`]
//!
//!   This API targets asynchronous producers, provides feedback about delivery,
//!   supports a request/response model as required by the IEEE 802.15.4
//!   standard and facilitates safe resource management.
//!
//! 2. Receiver API:
//!   - [`Receiver::try_allocate_consumer_token()`]
//!     Tries to allocate a consumer token that allows a single consumer to
//!     listen for requests.
//!
//!   - [`Receiver::release_consumer_token()`]
//!     Releases a previously
//!
//!   - [`Receiver::receive_request_async()`]
//!     Asynchronously waits until a matching request becomes pending and
//!     returns it. Also returns the token required to signal delivery to the
//!     sender.
//!
//!   - [`Receiver::poll_receive_request()`]
//!     Poll function that can be used to build futures waiting for pending
//!     requests. The poll result will return the request and a response token.
//!
//!   - [`Receiver::try_receive_request()`]
//!     Synchronously checks whether a matching request is pending. If so,
//!     returns the pending request together with the token required to signal
//!     delivery to the sender.
//!
//!   - [`Receiver::received()`]
//!     Releases the message slot and signals delivery to the sender.
//!
//!   - [`Receiver::receive()`]
//!     This is convenience method over [`Receiver::receive_request_async()`]
//!     and [`Receiver::received()`]. It handles message reception in a closure.
//!
//!   - [`Receiver::peek_request_async()`]
//!     Asynchronously waits until a matching request becomes pending and
//!     returns a copy of it without dequeuing the message from the channel.
//!
//!   - [`Receiver::poll_peek_request()`]
//!     Poll function that can be used to build futures waiting for pending
//!     requests. The poll result will return a copy of the request without
//!     dequeuing the message from the channel.

// TODO: Make a prioritized version of the channel for timestamped radio tasks
//       that allows awaiting changes to the queue front.
